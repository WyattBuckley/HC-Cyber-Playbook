I spent about 20 minutes googling myself to find anything about me that might show up on the internet and teh results were about as expected. At first just by googling my name, I only received results about a person with the same first and last name as myself and was a baseball player. After playing around with the way I entered my name and received some politicians that had the same name as me. However, I never ended up finding anything about me other than an old facebook account of mine that I have long since abandoned and no longer use, which I took as a reminder to delete it.
As for the weirdest law I could find about my local munincipality, I found a law that states you have to report a missing pet tiger to the authorities within 1 hour of it going missing.
